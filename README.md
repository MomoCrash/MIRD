# About 

A fresh take on the timeless brick breaker, more dynamic and juicier than ever.

ReBreaker takes the classic brick breaker formula and pushes it to the extreme. With a retro aesthetic, the game challenges you to beat your high score across a variety of levels. Grow the ball or the paddle, unleash lightning, or even slow down time in this upgraded version designed to be as satisfying as possible. ReBreaker focuses on impactful feedback and "juiciness," making every brick you destroy a pure shot of dopamine.
